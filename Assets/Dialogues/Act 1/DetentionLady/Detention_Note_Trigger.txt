Erin:Hey Jade… I have this detention note for Bruce, that is supposedly for today. Can you verify that this is authentic?
Jade:Let's see here… Hmmm…. Oh my, the handwriting and the signature seems to be quite sloppy and off… This seems to have been forged, most likely by Bruce. It hurts for me to tell you this, but as a teacher, I have the obligation to tell you the truth. 
Erin:Thank you Jade.
