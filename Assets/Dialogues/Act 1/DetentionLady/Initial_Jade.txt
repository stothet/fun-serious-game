Jade:Wow Erin! Surprised to see you here. Please don’t tell me you’ve been sent for detention…
Erin:Oh no, I’m just here to ask about Bruce Barkley. I suppose he’s a frequent visitor?
Jade:Barkley.. Yes, he’s a regular here. To my knowledge, he’s been going here for the past 4 years now, but I’ve been assigned here only since last year. 
Jade:*sighs* The poor boy has a lot of family problems and personal issues. He considers me as his confidant, so there’s not much I can tell. Why do you ask?
Erin:He’s been accused of stealing exam scripts from Principal Wilson, and I have been assigned to find the truth. Do you think he could have done this?
Jade:Oh dear… Personally, I don’t think he could do something as horrible as this. However, I’m not really in a position to tell you whether he could have done it or not. Honestly, I don’t know. I do sincerely hope he hasn’t.
Erin:I see.
Jade:Good day to you.
