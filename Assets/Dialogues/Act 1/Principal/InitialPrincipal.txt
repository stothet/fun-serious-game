Erin:You wanted to see me, sir?
Mr. Wilson:Ahh Erin! Glad you can make it. We have a crisis here right now. I was out today for lunch from 12 to 1, and when I came back, the exam scripts were gone!
Erin:Oh no, sir! Who would do such a thing?
Mr. Wilson:I have a good feeling that up-to-no-good Bruce Buckley was the one that did it! Look, is that not his cap on the floor? I'm not surprised, given his reputation and all.
Mr. Wilson:However, here in this good school, everyone's innocent until proven guilty, and we shall not tarnish anyone's good name without concrete evidence and sound argument.
Mr. Wilson:As head of the student council, I'm assigning you a new task: find out whether Bruce Buckley has stolen the exam scripts. 
Erin:Yes sir!
Mr. Wilson:Start by examining the crime scene here, see what clues and information you can find. Also, go around school and talk to some people. Your magical journal will record everything automatically (somehow), and your bag will serve nicely as a place to hold potential evidences.
Erin:Sure thing!
Mr. Wilson:At any stage, if you are unsure about the credibility of certain items you have collected, you should go and verify them by talking to the relevant people with the item on you.
Mr. Wilson:Remember to be thorough and objective in your mission! Come back to me when you have found everything you can to make your argument.
