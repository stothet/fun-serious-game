Erin:But Mr. Wilson, Selma wasn't here the whole time. She told me she left to grab a quick sandwich from 12.30 to 12.40!
Mr. Wilson:What? She never mentioned this to me...
Erin:I believe this means that the thief used this ten minute window to come and steal the scripts!
Mr. Wilson:I see...But that means he could have done it! And here we have his hat on the floor, right in the crime scene!
Erin:(...I should present an evidence right now...)
