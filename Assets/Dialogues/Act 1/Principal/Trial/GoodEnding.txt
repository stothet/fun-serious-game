Erin:Here, Mr. Wilson! This is the official cafeteria register for Bruce today, showing that he was having lunch there from 12.30 to 1! Lunchlady Rita gave this to me.
Erin:Therefore he couldn't have been here when Selma was absent.
Mr. Wilson:Let me have a look...I see. This is indeed solid alibi that Bruce couldn't have done this. You have convinced me, Erin. Good work!
Mr. Wilson:But if it wasn't Bruce...who could it have been??
