Wilson:Good work Erin! You have shown excellent ability to solve this case without letting bias cloud your judgement. 
Wilson:I am impressed with your analytical skills to discriminate between facts and baseless opinion. Overall, you have restored Bruce’s image.
Erin:Thank you sir!
Wilson:Work is not done, however. I still need you to go and find out who stole the scripts. Let's get going!
Erin:Yes sir!
