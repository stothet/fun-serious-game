Selma:...a peaceful afternoon ruined by some rotten thieves, and the week was going so well too...
Erin:Good afternoon, Selma!
Selma:Hi there Erin! On an errand again for Principal Wilson, are we?
Erin:Precisely so, for investigating the stolen scripts no less! Do you have any more knowledge of this incident? Have you seen anything, perhaps?
Selma:I wish I could, sweety. I had some extra paperwork to go through today so I thought I should take a shorter lunch break. 
Selma:I believe I went out from 12.30 to 12.40, nothing fancy, just grabbing a sandwich. That's the entire time I was absent for the hour, and I swear nobody could've sneaked by me while I was here!
Erin:Is that so? Interesting... Well, thanks for your help, Selma. Good day to you!
Selma:You too Erin!
