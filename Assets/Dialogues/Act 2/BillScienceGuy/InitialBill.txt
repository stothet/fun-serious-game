Erin:Hey there, I remember you from the Math Decathlon trials. You're in the same class as Bruce Buckley aren't you?
Bill:That is correct. And who might you be?
Erin:I am Erin, head of student council. I'm investigating a case involving Bruce Buckley. Can you tell me anything about him as a person in general?
Bill:Certainly. Bruce Buckleyâ€¦ I guess you know this already, but he's a big bully here in the school, and I experienced that first hand. He's roughed up many people in the school.
Erin:So I've heard.
Bill:But actually, lately I haven't been getting that much trouble from him anymore. Jimmy on the hand...Oh I shouldn't be telling you this. I do have to get back to my experiments, I'm on the verge of a breakthrough worthy of a Nobel! Hahaha!
Erin:Alright, good luck on that. See you later.
