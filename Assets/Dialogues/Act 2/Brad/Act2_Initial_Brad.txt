Erin:Hey there, Brad! Good practice session today?
Brad:Hey, what’s up Erin? Thanks for asking, it was a great session today. I’m totally pumped!
Erin:Nice to hear that, Brad. Listen, you used to hang with Bruce, right? Jimmy too, I think?
Brad:Yeah, we used to be on the hockey team together. We were really good friends back then, you know. Here’s a photo of us, see? 
Brad:Those hats were pretty cool, right? Only us three had it. It was for being the best player on the hockey team, wouldn't you believe it.
Brad:Unfortunately, we had a falling out, and we are not really on good terms these days. Why do you ask?
Erin:Oh, it’s just that some exam scripts have been stolen from the principal’s office. And it seemed that someone was trying to frame Bruce for it, too..
Brad:That sounds terrible! Who could to such a thing?
Erin:That’s why I’m here to gather more information about the case. Do you know someone that could have done this, perhaps?
Brad:Gee, I’m not sure...Bruce has wronged a lot of people in the past, although I hear he’s been trying to improve lately...Sorry, I don’t think I can help you on that one.
Erin:No problem, thanks for your help. By the way, would it be possible if I borrowed that photograph for a bit?
Brad:Oh this? No problem, take it!
Erin: Cheers, have a nice day!
