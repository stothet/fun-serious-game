Charles:Ehh what do you want? Can't you see I'm busy scrubbin' over here?
Erin:Oh sorry to interrupt mister. I'm currently investigating the case of the stolen exam scripts. Would you happen to…
Charles:Ehhh what's that? Scripts have been stolen? Can't help you there laddie, I don't know anything. I've been scrubbin' floors and doors all day and I'm sore. 
Erin:Ok…
Charles:It's probably that darn old Bruce boy, if you ask me. Have you looked into him yet? 
Charles:He's nothing but trouble. You don't know how many hours I have spent here, cleaning up his clogged toilets and stink bombs, thanks to that lad. A real joker, he thinks he is.
Charles:All right, I've wasted enough time already. Gotta get back to work.
Erin:Thanks for your help, mister. Goodbye!
