Mr. Wilson:Now that we have proved Bruce's innocence, we need to find out who's really behind this dreadful affair...
Erin:Of course, Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson:Here, before you carry on your investigation, I have found these leftover exam scripts on the floor.
Mr. Wilson:The culprit must have accidentally dropped this as he was leaving. You should have a closer look at them.
Erin:Yes sir!
Mr. Wilson:Incidentally, I think there's also something on the floor there too... I think we might have missed it the first time...
Mr. Wilson:Well, get to it then, and good luck!
Erin:Thank you, sir!
