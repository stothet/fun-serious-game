Erin:I have this photograph, from Brad. Apparently, these caps were quite special and only the three of them wore it.
Erin:As you can see, this matches the cap found at the crime scene.?
Mr. Wilson:I see. This covers the crime scene. But we still have several suspects. Can you narrow this down somehow?
Mr. Wilson:I recall some of these boys get themselves into detention an awful lot...
Erin:(...I should present an evidence now...)
