Erin:Here, I found the key to your office, right in the detention room! I believe Jade also had no knowledge of it.
Erin:It must have fallen out from the culprit's pocket while he was at detention.
Erin:From the process of elimination...This must mean Jimmy stole the scripts!
Mr. Wilson:My my, I believe we have solved the case! So it was Jimmy, very interesting! Well done Erin!
Erin:Thank you sir! My pleasure.
