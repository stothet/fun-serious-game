Erin:I have talked with Riley's Mother earlier today, and she said that Jimmy goes to detention a lot, but Brad never goes, actually.
Erin:She was quite certain of it.
Mr. Wilson:Hmm.... Ahh yes! That's right, Brad is on my honours list. He would never go to detention, how silly of me.
Mr. Wilson:I think you are onto something, Erin, but we are not quite there yet.
Mr. Wilson:Do you have any final pieces of evidence that can help us nail our culprit?
Erin:(...I should present an evidence now...)
