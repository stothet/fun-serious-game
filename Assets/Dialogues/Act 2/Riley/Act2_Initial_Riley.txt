Riley:Hello there!
Erin:Good afternoon, Madam.
Riley:I don't know if I can ask you this, but do you know a certain Jimmy, Jimmy Barkson? He usually wears a black skull T-shirt around school. I'm his mother, coming to pick him up after school.
Erin:Ahh yes, I know him.
Riley:Do you know if he will be finished soon? He's not in detention right now is he? 
Erin:To my knowledge, he isn't right now. Although I believe the last period still has half an hour before it finishes.
Riley:Oh that's a relief. I do wish Jimmy would learn to behave himself some more, you know? I think he's already been in detention twice this week. If only he can be like his friend Brad, who never goes to detentionâ€¦ Oh sorry, I'm muttering to myself. Well, good day to you, missy!
Erin:You too!
