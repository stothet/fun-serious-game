Selma:Oh hello Erin again! How is the case going?
Erin:I'm making good progress, I think.
Selma:That's good. Say, is that a spray cleaner you have there?
Erin:Why, yes. It is.
Selma:Seeing that just triggered my memory now...My fault for not mentioning this to you earlier - mind you, I was quite hungry - but I think the janitor, Charles, was coming in to clean the windows around here just as I was leaving for lunch. Think you'd be interested to know this.
Erin:I see, thanks for your information. I gotta get going, goodbye!
Selma:See you later!
