Erin:Hey there, Bill the Science Guy. I remember you from the Math Decathlon trials. You're in the same class as Bruce Buckley aren't you?
Bill:That is correct. And who might you be?
Erin:I am Erin, head of the student council. Could you tell me what kind of a person Bruce is? 
Bill:Certainly. Bruce Buckley... Oh, I think we are on pretty good terms. Apart from the fact that he has beaten me up and forced me to do his homework for everyday of my life! But other than that... Why do you need to know?
Erin:Well, Bruce has been accused of stealing exam scripts from the principal's office and I'm trying to figure out if he was the one behind it.
Bill:Your job is done then. Who else could it be, honestly? I hope he gets expelled so I don't have to be bossed around by that pathetic excuse for a human being ever again...
Erin:Hey, you don't have to...
Bill:Do you think someone who has so little regard for other people's efforts WOULDN'T steal exam scripts? Good riddance to him! Look how he scrunched up my Art History report! You can take it, it's all the evidence you'll ever need. 
Bill:Good day to you.
