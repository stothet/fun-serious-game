Erin: You are correct, that's what I'm doing. And you are...?
Jimmy: Oh me? I'm Bruce's good mate. I heard old Wilson's gone steamin' mad over this! What's he gonn do with Bruce? I sure as hell know BB would never do somethin like that! You gotta help him, I know he didn't do nothing, man!
Erin: Hey hey, calm down a bit. You were saying that he wasn't the one that did it? That's quite contrary to what most people are thinking...
Jimmy: Yeah, that be what I'm sayin'. I know, I know. He's messed up a lot of folks in the past...But I swear, he's gone cleaned up his act now. Brand new Bruce, he is. In fact, them scripts, they were stolen around lunchtime, yeah?
Erin: Hmm, yes. Around then.
Jimmy: Ah-ha! I knew he didn't do it. He was in detention then! Why here, I have his detention note right here. Take it, that outta prove his innocence! Thanks again!
