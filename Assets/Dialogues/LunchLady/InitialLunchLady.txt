Erin:Hello Lunchlady Rita, have you seen a Bruce Buckley here lately, around lunchtime?
Rita:Ahh hello there. Unfortunately, I don't think I can help you there... Lots of people come by here everyday... unless...
Erin:...Unless what?
Rita:Oh, you see, I need to do me accounts for today, but me calculator has broke! I can't add me numbers in my head very good, you know. 
Rita:Tough being an adult, kid. You look like a smart fella, though. Maybe if you do my accounts for me, you could jog my memory?
Erin:...Fine.
Rita:PHEW THANKS!!! I knew you is a smart kid. Glad I don't have to do these darn accounts myself. 
Erin:Ehem..
Rita:Oh yes.. The big boy.. I remember he was here around noon, relishing on one of my world-famous Sloppy Joes.
Rita:Here, you can find his signature in my register. Nasty eater. He probably needs a lesson or two in table etiquettes.
