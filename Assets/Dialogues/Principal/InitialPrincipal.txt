Erin:You wanted to see me, sir?
Mr. Wilson:Ah Erin! Glad you can make it. We have a crisis here right now. During lunchtime today, I went out for 5 minutes to grab a sandwich, and when I came back, the exam scripts were gone!
Erin:Oh no, sir! Who would do such a thing?
Mr. Wilson:I have a good feeling that up-to-no-good Bruce Buckley was the one that did it! He's the biggest troublemaker in this school...
Mr. Wilson:...However, here in this good school, everyone's innocent until proven guilty, and we shall not tarnish anyone's good name without concrete evidence and sound argument. 
Mr. Wilson:As head of the student council, I'm assigning you a new task: find out whether Bruce Buckley has stolen the exam scripts. Go around school and talk to some people, see what potential evidence and information you can find.
Erin:Yes sir!
Mr. Wilson:Remember to be thorough and objective in your mission! Come back to me when you have found everything you can to make your argument.
