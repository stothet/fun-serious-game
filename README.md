# fun-serious-game
A game based on a serious genre, built with the unity game engine.


## Running the game

### From the build file (.exe)
* Double click on the .exe file
* You should start at the main menu once the game has loaded.
* Click on the "New Game" button.


### From Unity
* Import the project folder into Unity.
* Switch to the MainMenu scene.
* Press the start game button.
* You should start at the main menu.
* Click on the "New Game" button.



### Known bugs in the Prototype (to be fixed for the final submission)
* With certain Unity builds, the initial dialogue may be incorrect when starting the game and user must press space to pass it. 
* When transitioning back to the game after completing the maths minigame, the dialogue box doesn't reopen.
* Starting the principal's trial and selecting "You were right to suspect him, Mr. Wilson" into "(as said my Rita)" option will bring up an empty dialogue (Why do you say that Erin, but still increases score). Going through the same process a second time ends the game.
* It is currently possible to end the principal's trial by continuing with spacebar. Doing this will add trial dialogue button options to Jimmy and Rita (unintended).
* (RESOLVED)Talking to Jimmy, then solving Rita's math minigame and then talking to Jimmy again will add duplicate Jimmy entries to the journal (this happens with or without collecting the register entry from Rita).
* (RESOLVED)Solving Rita's math minigame clears the journal. Talking to Rita, Bill, or Jimmy again to obtain the register entry restores journal state. However if Bill or Jimmy have been previously talked to, a duplicate entry will be made to the journal.


### Playtesting bugs 23/10
* When picking up the scrunched paper, a dialogue with a random npc begins (might need to play minigame first)
* Can walk off the map
* Dialogue sometimes overflows and has some typos
* Controls disappear after minigame until dialogue is completed
* Erin appears on top of the lunchlady after the minigame
* The basketball is too big
* The basketball hoops randomly disappear
* The journal/inventory times need updating eg Bruce's register entry.
* Leaving a room after clicking tilt on a computer gives a black screen
* Must start the trial twice
* Can't talk to Jimmy
* Walk animation for mobile joystick always goes up
* Lives aren't used during the trial
