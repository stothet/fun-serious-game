# fun-serious-game
A game based on a serious genre, built with the unity game engine.


## Running the game

### From the build file (.exe)
* Double click on the .exe file

* Click on the "New Game" button.

* Import the project folder into Unity.
* Switch to the MainMenu scene.
* Press the start game button.

### Known bugs in the Prototype (to be fixed for the final submission)
* With certain Unity builds, the initial dialogue may be incorrect when starting the game and user must press space to pass it. 
* When transitioning back to the game after completing the maths minigame, the dialogue box doesn't reopen.
* Starting the principal's trial and selecting "You were right to suspect him, Mr. Wilson" into "(as said my Rita)" option will bring up an empty dialogue (Why do you say that Erin, but still increases score). Going through the same process a second time ends the game.
